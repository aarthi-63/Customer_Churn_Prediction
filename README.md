# üîç Project Content: Bank Customer Churn Prediction

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to leave (churn) based on their profile and account activity.

## Steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   Handled missing values and outliers.
   Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot and Label Encoding.
   Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.

2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
   Analyzed churn rates across different demographics.
   Visualized feature distributions and correlations.

3. Modeling:
    Built and trained two models:
      üîπ  Logistic Regression
      üîπ  Random Forest Classifier

4. Evaluation Metrics:
   Used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

5. Model Comparison:
   Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression with higher F1-score and ROC-AUC.

6. Conclusion:
   Deployed the best-performing Random Forest model.
